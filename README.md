> NOTE: This was more of an idea I put into code because todoist.nvim wasn't working for me. But, I don't really plan to maintain it, and it's not really all that usable anyways, so if you're looking for a Todoist plugin, just use https://github.com/romgrk/todoist.nvim instead.

# nvim-todoist.lua - Todoist plugin for Neovim

## Setup + Installation

### Requirements
* [Neovim 0.5.0 (nightly)](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly)

Use your plugin manager of choice, like [vim-plug](junegunn/vim-plug) or
[packer.nvim](wbthomason/packer.nvim). Here's an example with vim-plug:

```vim
" Dependency
Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'

Plug 'smolck/nvim-todoist.lua'
```

Just make sure that no matter what package manager you use, 
you install [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) along with this plugin.

After you've done that, make sure to add this to your `init.vim` (after the `Plug` lines):

```vim
lua << EOF
require'nvim-todoist'.neovim_stuff.use_defaults()
EOF
```

If you don't do that, none of this plugin's functions, like `:Todoist`, will work!

### API Token

First, get your Todoist API token from https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations. After that, set the `$TODOIST_API_KEY` environmental variable to
that token.

## Usage

Call `:Todoist` from within Neovim, and you'll be greeted by a floating window with your `Inbox` tasks. Alternatively, you can call `:Todoist <project name>`, e.g. `:Todoist Welcome`, to view tasks from a specific project.
